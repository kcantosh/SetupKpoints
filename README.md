# SetupKpoints


This script uses the SeeKpath and ASE codes to take an input crystal structure and return a standardised k-path through the Brillouin zone. The path is chose *based on crystallography*.

If you do use this code you will require
* (SeeKpath)[https://github.com/giovannipizzi/seekpath]
* (ASE)[https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/about.html]
